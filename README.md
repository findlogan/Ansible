# Ansible

I'm working on learning Ansible, so I have also decided to open-source my playbooks, etc. for your projects as well.

MIT license, use it for your own projects, etc. If you feel compelled to give me money, I have a sponsorship page on GitHub where you can buy me a coffee to continue developing these in my afternoons. Otherwise, it's free. Enjoy.

If you are new to ansible, you can find a installation guide [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements)
